Both [Zack Kitzmiller](https://b.z19r.com/post/what-ive-been-watching) and [Shawn McCool](https://twitter.com/ShawnMcCool) have been keeping lists of technical videos worth watching, and I thought it was a great idea. Having watched a lot of their videos, I thought of a list of videos that I think are worth watching, and so here they are.

- [Ross Tuck - Models & Service Layers](https://rosstuck.com/phpnw13-models-service-layers-talk/)
- [Ross Tuck - HTTP & Your Angry Dog](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qBaMsYXtJ4)

Great talk about various MV\* JS frameworks
