I LOVE using web services to offload functionality from my application or workflow. From things like monitoring to logging to bug reporting, there are multiple paid services that will do this for you. And all of them are great.

However, there are sometimes situations where using a self-hosted, free solution might fit better for your organization/application. So I've compiled a list of these different web services for others to discover like I did.

### Source Control

[Gitlab](https://www.gitlab.com/): Self-hosted Git Solution. This is great for keeping your business's internal work within the network, or for any side client work you may want to do, without putting it up on public repos, like Github.

### Server Monitoring
[Amon](https://old.amon.cx/): Server Montioring Web Service. The creator has made a new version of this software, selling it as a SaaS. But he has made the old version open source and free for all.
