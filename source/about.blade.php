        <p class="mb-6">Hey there. I'm Phil Betley. I'm a web developer by trade, and you can find a lot of my thoughts on web and app development on this site.</p>

<p class="mb-6">In my spare time, I volunteer as a Scoutmaster of Troop 285, in the Del-Mar-Va Council, where I was also a scout as a kid.</p>

<p class="mb-6">I'm also a huge fan of Dungeons and Dragons, and play a regular weekly game with a group of college buddies.</p>
